            <p class="text-about">Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned <br> 
                with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary 
                science with multiple approaches, <br> but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a <br> 
                paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.</p>

            <p class="text-about">Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning algorithms instead allow 
                for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range.
                Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate '
                decision-making processes based on data inputs.</p>

            <p class="text-about">The gaming industry is certainly one of the thriving industries of the modern age and one of those that are 
                most influenced by the advancement in technology. With the availability of technologies like AR/VR in consumer products like 
                gaming consoles, the gaming sector shows great potential. The objective of a data scientist is to operate analytical skills 
                to build a machine learning model that can accurately <br> predict the sales in millions of units for a given game.</p>

            <p class="text-about">Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the workings <br> of the human brain
                 in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in 
                 artificial intelligence <br> that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is either <br> unstructured 
                 or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep <br> neural network.</p>
